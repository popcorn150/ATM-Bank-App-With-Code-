# If and Else
# set an x variable to the value 5
x = 5

# start the if / else conitional
if x <= 10
  puts x
  else
    puts "Number is greater than 10"
  end

  #  Basic elements used to evaluate conditionals:
#<   # less than
#>   # greater than
#<=  # less than or equal to
#>=  # greater than or equal to
#==  # equal to
#!=  # not equal to

Is 3 > 5 ?

puts 3 < 5

puts 5 == 5

puts 10 >= 10

puts 10 <= 12

puts 10 != 10

puts 10.object_id == 10.object_id

#What about strings?
puts "dog" == "cat"

puts "cat" == "cat"

puts "cat.object_id" == "cat.object_id"
